**Last updated:** _August 31, 2025_

${siteConfig.name} ("we", "our", "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website, application, and services (collectively, the "Service").

## Information We Collect
We may collect the following information when you use the Service:

- **Geolocation Information**:  
  We request your IP address through [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) to determine your **country code** and **country name**.  
  - We **do not store your IP address**.  
  - The country information is used solely to filter available watch providers provided by The Movie Database (TMDb).  
  - We store the **country code** and **country name** in your browserâ€™s **local storage** to improve your experience and avoid repeated lookups.

- **Analytics Data**:  
  We use **Google Analytics** to collect data about your interaction with the Service, such as page views, device information, and general usage patterns.  

- **Authentication Data**:  
  When you log in with your **TMDb account**, authentication is handled by TMDb.  
  - We **do not collect or store your TMDb email, password, or personal profile information**.  
  - We only store the **access token** provided by TMDb in **cookies** to keep you logged in.  

## How We Use Your Information
The information collected is used for the following purposes:
- To provide relevant watch providers based on your location.  
- To authenticate users through TMDb login using access tokens.  
- To analyze usage trends and improve the Service through Google Analytics.  

Please note: both geolocation (via ipinfo.io) and analytics (via Google Analytics) are **essential for the Service and cannot be disabled**.

## Cookies and Browser Data
${siteConfig.name} has features that require us to remember your preferences and identify who is logged in to our applications. We use a combination of browser cookies and your browser's local storage to track this information.
